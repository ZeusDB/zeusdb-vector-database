## [0.0.1] - 2025-06-17

### Added
- Initial implementation of the ZeusDB Vector Database Python package with Rust backend.

- Support for HNSW (Hierarchical Navigable Small World) indexing.

- Python bindings via PyO3 for creating and querying vector indexes.

- HNSWIndex class with support for:

  - Vector insertion with optional metadata.

  - Top-K nearest neighbor search with optional metadata filtering.

  - Support for multiple distance metrics: cosine

- Metadata storage and retrieval at both index and vector level.

- VectorDatabase Python wrapper class to manage index creation and usage.

- Example benchmarking script for inserting and querying vectors.

- Introduced a new GitHub Actions workflow (`Check Package (without publishing to PyPI)`) for verifying ZeusDB builds across all supported platforms without pushing to PyPI. Includes metadata validation and artifact inspection.

### Fixed
- Replaced deprecated `license-file` metadata with SPDX-compliant `license = "Apache-2.0"` in `pyproject.toml` to fix PyPI distribution validation errors.
- CI workflow now correctly uploads built wheels to PyPI by using the `dist/*` pattern in the maturin upload step, resolving an issue where no files were found for publishing.

### Changed
- CI workflow now explicitly installs and upgrades `pkginfo` alongside `twine` and `wheel` during artifact inspection. This prevents metadata validation errors (such as "Metadata is missing required fields: Name, Version") caused by outdated versions of `pkginfo`.
